					<h4>3.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</h4>

We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new page visit. Clearclaim uses the following types of cookies:</p>

These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.</li></ul>
					<p>You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional.

We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices and provide information that may be of interest to you.</p>
					<h4>3.3 Online Advertising</h4>
					<p>We use third-party advertising services like Facebook, Google’s ad services, and other ad networks and ad servers to deliver advertising about our Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services and may be tailored to your interests.

					<h3>6. Security</h3>

These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data.

We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Clearclaim. We use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period, like when you request that we keep you signed in. <strong>Why does Clearclaim use cookies and similar technologies?</strong> We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies both when you visit our site and services through a browser and through our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods. We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
					<figure className="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Authentication and security</strong></td><td>To log you into Clearclaim To protect your security To help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Clearclaim’s agreements</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
					<p>For example, cookies help authenticate your access to Clearclaim and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts</p>
					<figure className="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Preferences</strong></td><td>To remember data about your browser and your preferences To remember your settings and other choices you’ve made</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
					<p>For example, cookies help us remember the program you’re interested in, so we can provide communication relevant to this program each time you visit.</p>
					<figure className="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Analytics and research</strong></td><td>To help us improve and understand how people use Clearclaim</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
					<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of Clearclaim to see which features or content users prefer, web beacons help us determine which email messages are opened, and cookies help us see how you interact with Clearclaim, like the links you click on. We also work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel, who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them. You can opt out of some of these services through tools like the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> and <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out">Hotjar Opt-Out Cookie</a>.</p>
					<figure className="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Personalized content</strong></td><td>To customize Clearclaim with more relevant content</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
					<p>For example, cookies help us show a personalized list of recommended programs on the homepage.</p>
					<figure className="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Advertising</strong></td><td>To provide you with more relevant advertising</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
